If I have 2 and I have 3, this is a part and this is a part 
How many do I have over here and over here? We are going to put them together to get the total = 2 and 3 makes 5 (using hand guestures). Im going to write that on the board as well. 

Total stands alone
What numbers do you think we can try next to make a total
We want the total to be 5. What numbers can we use George (self-corrects from 5 + 5) 5 + 0
Zero doesnt mean anything (precise)  stands for nothing, corrects language
2+3 = 5

Number dash worksheet 
Misconceptions  students using two hands to find the missing amount  how can that be elevated
Students using blocks.  
How can we have students tell us how many blocks we start with
What do students do once they are done 

EM2 Number Bond Dash  Lesson 13 
How are students checking and reviewing each others work 

Which numbers did you use to make 5
Mela said she used 5 +5  Simone does say its wrong, tests it , shows that its 10 
What did you notice  some of them are the same, was the total always 5 
Launch:
We have 5 dogs. We need some to be inside and some to be outside. Models the thinking for students show 1 + 4 = 5. 
Leo- How many dogs are you keeping inside 5 + 0 
Leo shows how to write the (teacher said expression, meant equation) 

Small Group:  Start with 3 inside, teacher models circles and provides manipulatives
Match 3 inside to its partner outside 
Drawing in the box and then number below 
Students are pressed to final all 6 combinations for 5 
Many students have already transitioned from the symbolic to written notation, good to see that they are not being forced to use models or ways of thinking that are less sophisticated in their understanding 

Synthesis:
Teachers model using different colors to those the parts
Observing first
2+3 = 4 + 1 , is this a true statement? Noah- Noted that is it a fact, but didnt show how they could be manipulated. How could you prove it other saying its so.  

Consider if students would focus/engage more with student demonstration and facilitation

Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole.

There is evidence of a learning objective (LO). The objective clearly states what students will know  and be able to do at the end of the lesson in a way that students understand: Compare fractions with related numerators. The learning objective does not drive all lesson activities. Teacher omits core portions of the lesson- The majority of learning activities and materials are not tied to (or aligned with) instructional goals and objectives or district approved curricular materials.

Then they used a boy to compare a red flower and a yellow flower. The teacher asked students to share their answers but did not ask students to share reasoning and did not make connections between answers.

During the summary teacher checked understanding by asking students to demonstrate with a thumbs up if they go the same answer. The teacher summarized the learning of the lesson but with a limited focus on the big idea of the mathematics.

T: what did we discover about the flowers?
S: the yellow flower was longer than the red flower
T: how did you know that?
S: because i flipped the page and saw
T: did anyone use the boy?
S: I used the boy. The yellow flower was taller than the red one
T: were going to use that thinking with our exit ticket. Sometimes we use another object when we cant compare things side by side. First we used a plate because we cant get our foot next to a giraffe, then we used a stick, then we were able to use the boy.

Now were going to use the fence and the flamingo and the fence and the bird. Same kind of directions. The parrot is shorter than the flamingo. The parrot is taller than the flamingo. Draw or write to put the fence, flamingo and parrot in order from shortes to longest.

Teacher lanches with the Choral Response- Name the Shapes Activity Students name the polygons used to compose a larger polygon, and then name the composed polygon to prepare for decomposing and composing polygons.

Recognize that a system can be efficiently solved by substitution if one variable is already isolated or can be easily isolated. 

Recognize that there are multiple ways to perform substitution to solve a system of equations.

Solve systems of linear equations by substituting a variable with a number or an expression, and check solutions by substituting them back into the equations.

","HSA-REI.C.6 Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately (e.g., with graphs), focusing on pairs of linear equations in two variables.

The enacted lesson targets conceptual understanding of recognizing the role of substitution in the solution of systems of equations. Then, students are tasked with the procedural skill of identifying values that can be represented to substitution to solve aforementioned systems..

",3- Examples are used to make the mathematics of the lesson clear.,"2- Student solution methods are shared, but few connections are made to strengthen student understanding.","2- There are few checks for understanding, or the progress of only a few students is assessed. Instruction is not adjusted based on students needs.",2- The lesson includes a summary with limited focus on the mathematics.,"A Kahoot question reduces accessibility and rigor for students in defining the purpose of the lesson, and also prevents teachers from creating a living synthesis from the work of their students.

Use of phrases such as Did you get it? fail to properly assess if a student has understanding of subject.

Q1 in warm-up, quadrant 1 being used as a reference to check if an answer was correct was mentioned, but was not explained in detail, leaving some students confused.

The use of coat equivalency to assist students was thoughtful and intentional. In addition, a successful example awas used with the IN -> OUT use for substitution.

Students were asked to discuss in groups, and the majority of students (9/10, 12/13 students engaged) were able to take advantage of the opportunities provided. Students were responding to teacher-led ideas at times.

Examples from students were highlighted to showcase anticipated failures along with correct solutions. This was done with all answer choices and students were given the opportunity to explain and correct the work displayed by their peers.

Teacher used time during student discussion to walk around the classroom and ask leading questions to drive students towards answers. However, students were not given sufficient time to struggle productively.

The teacher provided many opportunities for students to work with/practice grade-level problems and exercises in small groups.

Activity 13.3 was modified into a Kahoot exercise, which increased engagement.

Interpret (orally and in writing) features of the graph (i.e., slope and y

Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualizeto abstract a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to their referentsand the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties of operations and objects.

CCSS.MP8 Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.
Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated, and look both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students might notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations over and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation (y - 2)/(x - 1) = 3. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding (x - 1)(x + 1), (x - 1)(x2 + x + 1), and (x - 1)(x3 + x2 + x + 1) might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.

The focus of this instruction was on teaching students how to find the slope of a line from a graph and equation by following the concept of ""rise/run."" The teacher contextualized this by mentioning that students might have heard this referred to as the ""rate of change"" in previous lessons, thereby establishing connections to prior learning.
Both sides of the room provided students with periods of opportunity to grapple with the material, yet these opportunities were not consistently seized with the desired fidelity.

The teacher maintained a proactive approach to checking for understanding throughout the lesson. This enabled them to identify misconceptions and areas for student growth and prompted them to adapt the lesson accordingly. However, feedback was primarily delivered through teacher-student interactions or within small groups, potentially limiting its reach to the entire class.
It's worth noting that only half of the room attempted the cooldown activity, while the other half was informed that they would address the remaining questions in the subsequent lesson.

The teacher's approach was notable in that it involved connecting and developing students' informal language and mathematical ideas, gradually guiding them toward more precise mathematical language and concepts. Some students began to employ increasingly precise mathematical language and ideas during the lesson. This was evident in the emphasis on terms like ""slope"" rather than ""rate of change"" and ""coordinates"" in place of ""points.""

The teacher did not stamp key understandings and connect the learning activities back to the purpose of the lesson.","1- Teacher provides few or no opportunities, or few or very few students take the opportunities provided.","1- Teacher provides few or no opportunities, or few or very few students take the opportunities provided.","1- Teacher provides few or no opportunities, or few or very few students take the opportunities provided.","1- Teacher provides few or no opportunities, or few or very few students take the opportunities provided.","1- Teacher provides few or no opportunities, or few or very few students take the opportunities provided.","The teacher provided a few opportunities for students to practice grade-level problems and exercises during independent and small-group worktime; a few students took the opportunities provided.

The teacher provided a few opportunities for students to productively struggle with the math content, during independent and small-group worktime; a few students took the opportunities provided.

The teacher prompted some students to share their responses to learning activities during whole-group discussion and small-group worktime. However, the teacher primarily focused on having the students state their answers rather than explain their thinking.

The small-group and whole-group discussions were teacher-led and not student-led. Students were responding to the teachers questions and prompts, rather than to one anothers ideas.

The teacher did not develop students precise math language and ideas. During small-group and whole-group discussion, students primarily utilized informal language to express their thinking. On one occasion, a student used the word equation in reference to inequality and this was not addressed by the teacher. The teacher also asked some leading questions when asking students to define key words such as maximum or at most. These were missed opportunities to improve student mastery of new math vocabulary/language.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,anonymous,26.0,enid aranda,16.6666666666666

The teacher primarily focused on sharing solutions, rather than explanations, representations, and/or examples.

Student solutions methods were shared for all questions posed in the lesson, and significant time was spent on discussion around student submitted solutions. However, some students were left confused on what they should be discussing in groups, or the objective of activities. (6/10 students engaged in productive conversations with peers, 3/10 demonstrated understanding.)

Lesson was adapted to suit the pacing of the period: by cutting activity 5.3, and modifying the order of questions provided to increase exposure to graphs. However, many students did not receive enough time for proper assessment of understanding.

Lesson synthesis was omitted from the lesson.

Teacher did not allow students enough time to productively struggle. Students were often given answers before meaningful time had passed to productively struggle.

The teacher provided many opportunities for students to explain their thinking about the content of the lesson. Students were asked to share solutions that were targets of anticipated failure, with questions posed to overcome them.

However, the teacher also asked broad questions during whole-group discussion that left some students from answering due to confusion on what was being asked.

A wide variety of students were targeted to share their solutions on the whiteboard. 

Students are placed in pairs/groups to encourage conversation. 6/10 students engaged in productive conversations with peers.

Specific students that demonstrated an understanding of the subject were prompted by the teacher to assist other students in a productive manner.

Students were not given enough time to develop informal language and were instead led by the teacher to copy pronunciation, which was not reinforced.

Checks for understanding were missing from the lesson, or were administered on an individual basis that did not change the course of the lesson.

Student solutions methods were not shared for classroom discussion.

(3/6 students engaged in productive conversations with peers, 4/6 demonstrated understanding.)

The teacher called on students to share solutions in small groups or not at all. The teacher primarily focused on sharing solutions, rather than explanations, representations, and/or examples.

Students are placed in pairs/groups to encourage conversation. 3/6  students engaged in productive conversations with peers.

Specific students that demonstrated an understanding of the subject were prompted by the teacher to assist other students in a productive manner.

The teacher also asked broad questions during whole-group discussion that left some students from answering due to confusion on what was being asked.

Teacher did not allow students enough time to productively struggle. Students were often given answers before meaningful time had passed to productively struggle.

The teacher provided few opportunities for students to work with/practice grade-level problems and exercises in small groups. The majority of students (5/6 students) were engaged with the activity provided.
